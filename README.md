This code is for a JeeNode from [jeelabs.com](jeelabs.com)

The idea is to create a JeeNode that controls an already installed LEDnode to display nice color transitions. Getting visually satisying transitions turns out to be quite difficult so I'm going to reuse the FastLED library for color conversion.

You need the following libraries installed in your Arduino environment:

  - JeeLib.h from [https://github.com/jcw/jeelib](https://github.com/jcw/jeelib)
  - FastLED from [https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED)
